Programming languages allow programmers to communicate with computers, telling them what to do and how to do it. There are many different programming languages, each with its own syntax and set of features. Some languages are designed for specific tasks, such as web development or scientific computing, while others are more general-purpose and can be used for a wide variety of applications."

In Japan they even have store closing times that go beyond 24:00. If a store closes at 26:00, what time is this in the 12-hour format? Use Python to find the answer, and explain as in the 16:20 example."
